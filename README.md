## Lebanese Bus Routes

This repository is the start of getting all the bus and van routes in Lebanon under one place.

These routes have always been available but not everyone knows about them.

### Why are we doing this
* We are providing Lebanese People an alternative in their daily commute
* There isn't a unified place where you can find these Routes
* It gives opportunities for people to develop tools if this information was public and free.
* In addition, these routes are never static and always changing and the best people who know this are the people who already use it.


We are putting all these routes into a `Google My maps` which can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1F367Y0wIb2QAU39bC1vfqJ7hAD_W56qy).

The bus Routes are organized into layers where each layer is represented in a *From District* - *To District* format according to the following [Lebanese District Map](). We got this from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Lebanon).

In addition each route will be as a separate KMZ file which would then be used with the Google Maps API later on. These files can be found in the [KMLs KMZs folder](https://github.com/EbrahimKaram/Lebanese-Bus-Routes/tree/master/KMLs%20KMZs).

If you want to contribute to the map, please check the [following document](https://github.com/EbrahimKaram/Lebanese-Bus-Routes/blob/master/How%20to%20Contribute%20to%20The%20Map.md) on how to do that.
