As reference to what you are tryin to make,
please check the following [link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1F367Y0wIb2QAU39bC1vfqJ7hAD_W56qy).

***Recommended***
1. Use a laptop or PC
2. Use a mouse
3. Have a decent internet connection
4. Take your time. Don't rush the routes

## Adding a new or Updated Route
### Open Google Drive

1. Go to [`drive.google.com`](https://drive.google.com)

  a. Create a Gmail if you don't have one already

  b. Select `My drive`

2. Right-click in the White Panel Area

3. **Select** `More` then **Select** `Google My Maps`

It will open a new Tab with something familiar to Google Maps

### Add a Layer with the Bus Route and Bus Stops
4. In the new Tab, click on `Add-Layer`.
5. Name the layer as the bus Route or bus number.
For example, `Bus 15` or `Dora- Bikfaya` (_Please note:_ The Route is in the form of **start-Finish**)
6. Under the Google Search bar, there is the `Draw a line` option.
 **Select** that and start drawing the bus route by **clicking** the various points on the map.

  a. Name the line the same as what you called the `Layer`.
  To do this, click on the `Line`.
  The line will become highlighted and the then a `pen` icon will show.
  **Click** on that.

  b. Add any info you might know in the description(*The box below the name*).
   For example, pricing or time tables

  c. Preferable to make the bus route and bus stop the same color. In the layer, you will find `Individual styles`.
  **Click** on it then **select** `Uniform Style`.
  **Hover** on `All items` then **click** on the Bucket icon and select a color.

I understand that this bus routes are *long*, so whenever you feel like it.
**Double Click** the last point you made.
Then whenever you are ready again, **click** on the line again.
**Choose** the edit option.
**Right Click** the last point and **select** `extend line`

### Export The new Layer into a KML
1. In the upper left corner, there are 3 vertical dots. **Click** on that
2. **Select** `Export to KML/KMZ`
3. Instead of `Entire Map`. **Select** the layer you just made.
4. Then **click** on `download`
5. `Select` where you want to download the file

It would be preferble if you saved the KML in the form `Start-Finish-Your Name`

### Fill out the Form
1. Go to the following [form](https://goo.gl/forms/erzaPRBJAhL6V19X2)
2. **Fill** out all the fields in the form
3. **Select** the `Upload a new route` option or `Fix an old route` in the *What would you like to do?* question. (Depending on your scenario)
4. **Upload** your KML in the Form (Gmail is required)

## Adding more Info to an Existing Route
